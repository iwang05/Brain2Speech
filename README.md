# Brain2Speech
The data files have been seperated to each single channel for each subject. In each file, every single column is a single trial and the last line is the number of category (i.e. 0 or 1). (In the training stage, the whole input matrix will be transposed to be the standard form as a machine learning algorithm input.)
- The repository is an updated version of the original toolkit by [@Teresa00](https://github.com/Teresa00/Brain2Speech). Refer to the Change Log for details of the changes.
