# Brain2Speech
All updates on this project has been moved to [brain2speech.io](https://brain2speech.github.io/), and the dedicated github account [Brain2Speech](https://github.com/Brain2Speech).
The algorithms for Brain2Speech are freely available under a 2-clause BSD license. 

The data files have been seperated to each single channel for each subject. In each file, every single column is a single trial and the last line is the number of category (i.e. 0 or 1). (In the training stage, the whole input matrix will be transposed to be the standard form as a machine learning algorithm input.)
- The repository is an updated version of the original toolkit by [@Teresa00](https://github.com/Teresa00/Brain2Speech). Refer to the Change Log for details of the changes.
